HOWTO
=====

* Create ~/.spambayes/

* Edit <yourpassword> in tte

* Prepare the cron job that trains the spam filter
  1. ``crontab -l`` to find out what's in it
  2. ``crontab my.crontab`` to replace it with the contents of
     ``my.crontab``.  If there was any output from step 1. you'll want
     to merge that into my.crontab first.

* Edit several instances of <YOUR USERNAME HERE> and <YOUR PASSWORD
  HERE> in .spambayesrc

* file spam messages into training.spam

* file ham (non-spam) messages into training.ham

* run ~/.spambayes/tte on the server just to get things started

* watch the folders INBOX, filtered.unsure, and filtered.spam for
  misclassified/unsure messages.  Move or copy them into training.ham
  or training.spam, as appropriate.  After a short while you'll stop
  looking at filtered.spam, because false positives stop happening :-)

Web Interface
-------------

* ssh into the mail server tunneling port 8007 and run a little
  webserver ::

    ssh -L 8007:localhost:8007 boostpro.com sb_imapfilter.py
    
* point your web browser at http://localhost:8007

* enjoy.
